# ROS2 Turtlebot based on old iRobot Create 1 platform
The idea is to take an "old" iRobot Create 1 base, add a Raspberry Pi 3B (or better), a Lidar scanner from Neato botvac, BNO055 IMU - and have it do navigation similar to modern Turtlebot 3.

There is an **updated version of this guide**, but some info here is still very relevant - https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/tree/main/Docs/Create1

## Software wise there are two projects:
1. There are drivers on GitHub for Create 1 (also works with Roomba 400, 500, 600 series), BNO055 UMU and XV11 Laser Scanner. They are capable of running on the on-board Raspberry Pi 3B and must be slightly modified and combined with a single launch.py file. On-boot autostart service is created.

2. For a desktop operation I run "_turtle_" robot from my https://github.com/slgrobotics/articubot_one repository.

## So, the steps are:

1. Set up Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS2 Jazzy on your Linux desktop machine (mine is Intel I7 with 16GB memory) - https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/tree/main/Docs/ROS-Jazzy
2. Set up ROS2 and robot drivers on Raspberry Pi (3B, 4, 5) - folder *[RPi_Setup](https://github.com/slgrobotics/turtlebot_create/tree/main/RPi_Setup)*
3. Teleoperate the robot using the desktop's joystick - folder *[Turtle_Setup](https://github.com/slgrobotics/turtlebot_create/tree/main/Turtle_Setup)*
4. Map your room by running ROS2 Cartographer package
5. Navigate around by using Nav2 package
6. Optionally, explore cameras and other devices on the robot

## Below is my Turtlebot setup

I have a powered USB hub ("Belkin") for the Laser scanner, and some obsolete router 9V power for my prior experiments. The Raspberry Pi and USB hub are powered from a 3S LiPo battery through a 5V Buck converter. The Raspberry Pi 3B is connected to Create 1 Base via FTDI USB-to-TTL-Serial adapter, pins 1,2 and 14.

I use Pixhawk standard I2C connectors for convenience, feeding 3.3V to its VCC rail. BNO055 IMU is connected to it.

## If you have genuine analog gyro connected to DB25 Pin 4 - do nothing

**Note from Ross Lunan:**
*If using Kinect and a Cargo Bay Expansion Board (from IHeartEngineering) that has a Gyro and 12 v regulator to power the Kinect. The Kinect power is enabled by a +5v from the "Digital Output 0".
This enabling was originally done by a "Breaker" python script that runs in the original turtlebot_bringup/minimal.launch.
The Autonomy driver does not have a code to drive this Digital Output (Create OI Index 147). But you can jury-rig a wire jumper (or small resistor, 100..150 Ohm) between DB25 Pins 8 (Switched 5V) to Pin 19 (Digital Output 0 a.k.a. Regulator "Enable" Pin).
Works like a charm providing regulated +12 v/1.5 A for the onboard Kinect.*

## Instead of analog gyro, here's my "analog gyro emulator" (Arduino + MPU9250)
only needed for Create 1, if you don't have analog gyro or genuine accessory board. See [this link](https://github.com/slgrobotics/Misc/tree/master/Arduino/Sketchbook/MPU9250GyroTurtlebot):
